While we have seen teams like Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings assert their dominance in both the IPL and the CLT20 during the last decade, there have been three teams that have never had the chance to lift the IPL trophy i.e RCB, DC and PBKS. since 2019 DC is qualifying in playoffs, also they played their first IPL Final in 2020 against Mumbai Indians but they lost the match against the most successful team in IPL. Unlike Kings XI Punjab or Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals have had some very strong players on their side over the years but it's their bad decisions which are holding them back from winning a title. In 2008, they had the chance to sign Virat Kohli as the U-19 player but they opted for Pradeep Sangwan instead. The Delhi-based outfit has let go of T20 heavyweights such as AB De Villiers, David Warner, Andre Russell and Glenn Maxwell.
